# AskPlex

AskPlex is an Alexa skill that allows you to play music hosted by your Plex Media Server (PMS).
The official Plex skill is not available in all regions, so this skill serves as an alternative.

> ***Disclaimer:*** AskPlex does not provide any media content or sources. Users must provide their own content from a Plex Media Server. The AskPlex project does not support bootleg content or other illegally sourced material.
